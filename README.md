# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2023

## Theme : REVERSE
Our first thought to the theme "Reverse" was to implement reverse features such as reverse levels. We then started brainstroming ways that we could include levels in which there is the "forwards"/"correct" way of direction for the player to travel, and then once that way is completed we could reverse the direction of play. We created a tower in which once the player reahces the top, it would then flip and the player would then have to travel upwards once again but this time all the platforms and tower itself are inverted. After brainstorming this level design we wanted to implement the theme into the music as well. So, we created a background loop of music which when the player reaches the inverted tower, would play in reverse.

## Game Play
The objective of our game is to completed both the correct inversion of the tower and the inverted version. To complete both, the player must climb a top platforms inside of the tower and parkour their way up to the top.

## Impediments
Some struggles in the development stage of our game is time management of adding in all of the features we had all brainstromed. We quickly realized that what we wanted (idealy) was not all feasible in the amount of time we had to create this game. We also had some struggle with getting the player to work properly.
